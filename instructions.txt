Welcome. Space Invaders is a very fun game to play. You are controlling a spaceship which is flying through space. 

There are waves of enemies that are trying to attack you. Your goal is to make it as far as possible throughout the game.

Each level is a wave of enemies. As you get through levels, the waves of enemies will become tougher and tougher.

Make sure you try to kill every single enemy possible, because if an enemy reaches the bottom of the screen, you lose a life.

Also try to avoid as many enemy attacks as possible. When you have no more lives or your spaceship health is out, you lose.

All your scores are saved, and you can view all your scores on the scores display page, and see your highest score as well.

You can only start the game from the main menu, not from the game over, scores display or this instructions page.
