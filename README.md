Hello, this is a Space Invaders project.

This project uses the python programming language.

The player is controlling a spaceship which is flying in space and waves of enemies are attacking it.
The player spaceship has to try and kill as many enemies as possible, while also trying to avoid losing lives and health. 

As the game progresses and each level increments to the next one, the wave of enemies gets tougher. 

There is one additional dependency needed to install from requirements.txt.
Additional dependencies: pygame
